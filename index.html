            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hie everyone. A little bit about myself. I am from Zimbabwe , specifically the City of Kings and Queens 'Bulawayo'. 
                Born and raised there. Off all the cities in Zimbabwe, Bulawayo is by far my favourite. It is quiet and 
                easy to navigateI have been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ since 2017 after gaining my testimony of the truthfulness of
                the gospel. I love the gospel and love the teachings as well, not forgetting singing.
                I work as a Finance Officer, and as you can see and tell I am expanding to the world of Web, something totally new and different.
                I feel its time for me to move on and do something. I usually dont have time, but I create time to spend with family, friends doing 
                outdoor activities, indoor games, travelling among other things. I would love to know all of you and hope it will be
                a great semester.</p>
