            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Francina Shanana from Zimbabwe , specifically the City of Kings and Queens 'Bulawayo'.
                Born and raised there. Off all the cities in Zimbabwe, Bulawayo is by far my favourite. It is quiet and
                easy to navigate. I have been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, since 2017
                after gaining my testimony of the truthfulness of
                the gospel. I love the gospel and love the teachings as well, not forgetting singing.
                I work as a Finance Officer,and expanding to the world of Web, something totally new and different.
                I feel its time for me to move on and do something. I usually dont have time, but I create time to spend
                with family, friends doing
                outdoor activities, indoor games, travelling among other things. </p>
